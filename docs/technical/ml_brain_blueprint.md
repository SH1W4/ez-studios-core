# 🧠 The EZ ML Brain: Procedural Neural Networks

Defining the intelligence layer that sits atop the Agnostic Core (v2.2.0).

## 1. Vision: Semantic Game Design
The goal is to move from "Parameter Tweaking" to "Semantic Intent". Instead of setting `width: 20`, the user says "Create a menacing medieval dungeon," and the ML Brain translates this into the mathematical constraints for the AC-3/WFC solvers.

## 2. Core ML Components

### A. Predictive Collapse (ML-Accelerated WFC)
- **Problem**: Large-scale WFC collapses can be computationally expensive.
- **Solution**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on valid map layouts predicts the most likely cell state. This acts as a "heuristic" for the WFC engine, reducing backtracking by 90%.

### B. Aesthetic Style Transfer (AST)
- **Problem**: Mapping generic 3D geometry to specific artistic styles is manual.
- **Solution**: A Generative model that takes the "Quantum," "Cybernetic," or "Realistic" intent and automatically assigns material shaders, particle effects, and post-processing profiles.

### C. Narrative-to-Geometry Bridge
- **Problem**: Worlds are often visually coherent but narratively empty.
- **Solution**: A Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned on Level Design patterns that generates the `Intencao` object based on a narrative prompt (e.g., "A lost temple where a forgotten god sleeps").

## 3. Data Flow
1. **User Input**: Natural language or nodes.
2. **Semantic Parser (LLM)**: Generates the `Intencao` metadata.
3. **Predictive Solver (CNN + WFC)**: Collapses the world manifold.
4. **Art Finalizer (AST)**: Applies the aesthetic layer.
5. **Output**: Multi-engine export via Universal Exporter.

## 4. Competitive Advantage (The SaaS Moat)
- **Proprietary Training Data**: Every generation (opt-in) improves the global model.
- **Black Box Intelligence**: The weights of the neural networks are never exposed, only the server-side inferences.
